     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>
        <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Waluigi">Waluigi</a> 
        is the most superior, dominant Nintendo character there
        is. He is so tall, so lanky, power rises from his boots up to 
        his bodacious mustache. Normally, people think of him as the
        anti-luigi. However, that is blasphmey. He is the one, the savior.
